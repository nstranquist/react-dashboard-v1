# Dashboard-V1 (React.js)
## Purpose:
To get functionality of the core dashboard features with a minimal user-interface.  

## About Project:
This project is using Firebase/Firestore for the backend, and  
Uses React.Js for the front end, as well as  
Materialize.css for some of the user-interface.  

## Still working on:
- Favicon isn't showing  
- More functionality  
- Sign Up errors aren't being displayed  
- Completely new User-Interface
