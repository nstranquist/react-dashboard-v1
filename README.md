# Dashboard-V1 (React.js)
### Live [Here](https://event-dashboard-dee20.firebaseapp.com)

## Purpose:
To get functionality of the core dashboard features with a minimal user-interface.  

## About Project:
This project is using Firebase/Firestore for the backend, and  
Uses React.Js for the front end, as well as  
Materialize.css for some of the user-interface.  

## Still working on:
- Much more functionality (reviews, integrating maps, etc)  
- Sign Up errors aren't being shown to user  
- Needs integration with our custom-made user-interface  
- Needs to be connected to our landing page
